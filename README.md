# Towers of Hanoi Animation
This project is an implementation of the classic puzzle game, Towers of Hanoi, using the Python turtle library. The game involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following a set of rules. The objective is to move the entire stack to another peg, without placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

## How to run the code
The code for this project can be run on Trinket.io, a platform for running and sharing Python code in the browser. Simply click on the "Run" button on the top menu to start the animation.
