# Towers of Hanoi Animation
This project is an implementation of the classic puzzle game, Towers of Hanoi, using the Python turtle library. The game involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, following a set of rules. The objective is to move the entire stack to another peg, without placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

## How to run the code
The code for this project can be run on [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/python/29be27063a?runOption=run), a platform for running and sharing Python code in the browser. The animation should play automatically.

## Credits
This project was created by Julius Broomfield for CSc 2510.
